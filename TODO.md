# RaftCLI ToDo list

[] consider whether to allow entry of ssid and password in CLI written to sdkconfig.defaults file or possibly to a config.ini type file that is .gitignored
[] possibly include size of flash as a user input - issues with this are different flash types such as OCTAL in addition to size
